Certainly! Below is a rollback shell script based on the details you provided. This script will revert to the previous version:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Function to find the current version
find_version() {
    cat $1 | grep 'ltfsre-cyclops digital banking service-preprod:v' | head -1 | awk -F':' '{print $2}' | awk -F'v' '{print $2}'
}

# Check if the script argument is provided
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <filename>"
    exit 1
fi

# Get the current version
currentVer=$(find_version $1)

# Calculate the previous version
prevVer=$(expr $currentVer - 1)

# Check if previous version is valid
if [ "$prevVer" -lt 1 ]; then
    echo "No previous version available to rollback."
    exit 1
fi

echo "Current Version : v$currentVer"
echo "Rolling back to Version : v$prevVer"

# Replace the current version with the previous version in the file
sed -i "s/:v$currentVer/:v$prevVer/g" $1

echo "Rollback completed."
```

### How to use the script:
1. Save the script to a file, for example, `rollback.sh`.
2. Give execute permission to the script: `chmod +x rollback.sh`.
3. Run the script with the file name as an argument: `./rollback.sh <filename>`.

Replace `<filename>` with the actual file name containing the version information.

This script reads the current version, calculates the previous version, and updates the file to reflect the rollback. Ensure to have a backup of your file before running the script.
